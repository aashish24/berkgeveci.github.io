title: About
---

I lead the [Scientific Computing team](http://www.kitware.com/company/team_scicom.html) at
[Kitware](http://www.kitware.com) where I enjoy working with many super talented and wonderful
individuals. My main interests are high performance computing, data analysis and visualization
at scale. I have had the pleasure of being a [VTK](http://www.vtk.org) and
[ParaView](http://www.paraview.org) developer since I joined Kitware in 2000.

Before joining Kitware, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania working
on optimal control applications in the control of hydrothermal instabilities. Prior to that,
I got my Ph.D. at Lehigh University in Mechanical Engineering where I conducted research on
subsonic and supersonic flow induced nonlinear vibrations, developing a new procedure for
the solution of coupled flow and structural equations.
