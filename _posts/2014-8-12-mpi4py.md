We recently added [mpi4py](http://mpi4py.scipy.org/) as one of the third party
libraries in VTK. Below is a quote from the mpi4py explaining what it is.

> MPI for Python (mpi4py) provides bindings of the Message Passing Interface
> (MPI) standard for the Python programming language, allowing any Python
> program to exploit multiple processors.
>
> This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1/MPI-2 specification and
> provides an object oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2 C++
> bindings. It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective
> (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of any picklable Python
> object as well as optimized communications of Python object exposing the
> single-segment buffer interface (NumPy arrays, builtin bytes/string/array
> objects).

See the mpi4py page for details.

We have been using mpi4py in ParaView for several years and with the recent
introduction of the `numpy_interface` module to VTK, we decided to move the
mpi4py dependency to VTK as well. This allowed us to support data parallelism
with MPI in the `numpy_interface` module. I will discuss this in an upcoming
blog in more detail.

Using mpi4py is pretty straightforward. The following can be called from
vtkpython, pvtkpython and python.

{% highlight python %}
from mpi4py import MPI
{% endhighlight %}

Note that if you are going to mix parallel VTK and mpi4py, we recommend using
pvtkpython, which initializes several VTK data structures that make it easier
for algorithms to access MPI communicators.

VTK also provides a Python-accessible interface to MPI in the vtkMPIController
and vtkMPICommunicator classes. However, these classes were not designed to be
used from Python and as such provide only a small set of methods. Most
often, you will use mpi4py when coding in Python.

In some cases, specially when using MPI groups, it is necessary to pass the
communicator used by VTK to mpi4py or vice versa. We developed a simple
utility class to enable this. This class is called vtkMPI4PyCommunicator and
is used as follows.

{% highlight python %}
import vtk
from mpi4py import MPI

# GlobalController is defined automatically when running pvtkpython
# Otherwise, you need to manually create a vtkMPIController and set
# it yourself.
contr = vtk.vtkMultiProcessController.GetGlobalController()
comm = vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToPython(controller.GetCommunicator())

acomm = vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToVTK(comm)
acontr = vtk.vtkMPIController()
acontr.SetCommunicator(acomm)
{% endhighlight %}

Since mpi4py works very nicely with numpy arrays and VTKArray is a subclass of
`numpy.ndarray` (see previous posts
[[1](http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/709)],
[[2](http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/713)] and
[[3](http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/714)]), it is very straightforward
to use them together as follows.

{% highlight python %}
import vtk
from vtk.numpy_interface import dataset_adapter as dsa
from mpi4py import MPI
import numpy

gc = vtk.vtkMultiProcessController.GetGlobalController()

rank = gc.GetLocalProcessId()

fa = vtk.vtkFloatArray()
fa.SetNumberOfTuples(10)
fa.FillComponent(0, rank)
if rank == 0:
    fa.SetValue(3, 10)

vtk_array = dsa.vtkDataArrayToVTKArray(fa)
result = numpy.array(vtk_array)

comm = vtk.vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.ConvertToPython(gc.GetCommunicator())
comm.Allreduce([vtk_array, MPI.FLOAT], [result, MPI.FLOAT], MPI.MAX)

if rank == 0:
    print result
{% endhighlight %}

When this is executed as

{% highlight sh %}
mpiexec -n 2 pvtkpython parallel_array.py
{% endhighlight %}

it prints

{% highlight python %}
[  1.   1.   1.  10.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.]
{% endhighlight %}

In my next blog, I will talk about how to use the `algorithms` module
in parallel. Until then, happy Message Passing.

*Many thanks to Ben Boeckel for moving mpi4py to VTK and implementing
vtkMPI4PyCommunicator.*
