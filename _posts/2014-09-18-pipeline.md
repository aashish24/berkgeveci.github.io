title:  "A VTK pipeline primer (part 1)"
---

In my last two blogs ([1]({% post_url 2014-9-5-vtk-python-algorithm %}),
[2]({% post_url 2014-9-13-h5py-reader %})), I introduced the `vtkPythonAlgorithm`
and started demonstrating how it can be used to develop sources and algorithms
in Python. In those articles, I touched on a few VTK pipeline concepts. For
those are not familiar with VTK's pipeline, this may have been somewhat hard
to follow. So in this article and the next, I will take a step back and explain 
how VTK's pipeline works in more detail.

## Preliminaries

### `vtkInformation` and `vtkInformationVector`

These two classes are used all over the VTK: in algorithms, in executives,
in data objects. They were developed by Brad King when we overhauled the VTK
pipeline in VTK 4. Conceptually, they are simply maps. The key is a pointer
to an instance of a `vtkInformationKey` (or of a subclass) and the value is an
instance of `vtkObjectBase` (or of a subclass). Let's start with an example.

{% highlight python %}
1   import vtk
2   from vtk.util import keys
3   
4   key = keys.MakeKey(keys.ObjectBaseKey, "a new key", "some class")
5   print "key:\n", key
6   
7   info = vtk.vtkInformation()
8   print "info:\n", info
9   
10  key.Set(info, vtk.vtkObject())
11  print "info after set:\n", info
{% endhighlight %}

This will print the following.

{% highlight sh %}
key:
vtkInformationObjectBaseKey (0x7f8390698680)
  Reference Count: 1

info:
vtkInformation (0x7f8390466ff0)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 51
  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)

info after set:
vtkInformation (0x7f8390466ff0)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 54
  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)
  a new key: vtkObject(0x7f839069b130)
{% endhighlight %}

On line 4, we created a new key type. Most often you will use existing keys but it
is useful to know how to create them. This key has a name `a new key` and location
`some class`. The latter is usually the name of the class this key is accessed from.
More on that later. One line 7, we create an empty information object. On line 10,
we add a new `vtkObject` to the information object. Not that line 10 looks backwards
and it feels more natural to do the following instead.

{% highlight python %}
info.Set(key, vtk.vtkObject())
{% endhighlight %}

Both of these work. We'll see below why. As I mentioned above, the values stored
in an information object are all `vtkObjectBase` and subclass instances. However,
it is relatively easy to store simple types by wrapping them with simple
`vtkObjectBase` subclasses. For example, we can store integers easily as below.

{% highlight python %}
key = keys.MakeKey(keys.IntegerKey, "another key", "some class")

key.Set(info, 12)
print info
{% endhighlight %}

This prints

{% highlight sh %}
vtkInformation (0x7fc3f0db0c80)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 55
  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)
  a new key: vtkObject(0x7f8078e87be0)
  another key: 12
{% endhighlight %}

This example may have made it a bit more clear why the methods to set values
on information objects are in the key classes. Using the keys' API to set
values enables us to store multiple types without having to make
`vtkInformation` aware of all types. As long as it can wrap a value or a set
of values in a subclass of `vtkObjectBase`, a key can store data of any type.
On the other hand, `vtkInformation` can only provide the API for the key types
it is aware of. You can verify this by checking out `vtkInformation.h`. It has
individual set/get methods for each key type it recognizes. Since most of the
code that interact with information objects use already defined key types, you
will see the `information.Set(key, value)` signature much more often. If you
define your own key type, you will have to use the `key.Set(information,
value)` signature.

Most often, you will access existing keys rather than create new ones. Keys
created in C++ usually exist with the scope of a class and are accessed by
calling a static member function. Like so:

{% highlight python %}
info = vtk.vtkInformation()
info.Set(vtk.vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER(), 1)

print vtk.vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER()
print info
{% endhighlight %}

This will print the following.

{% highlight sh %}
vtkInformationIntegerKey (0x7fe688c8fa50)
  Reference Count: 1

vtkInformation (0x7fe688e4ff80)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 66
  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)
  UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER: 1
{% endhighlight %}

When writing code in C++, you can use various macros to create keys. For example,
`vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER()` is created using the
following.

* vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.h:

{% highlight cpp %}
static vtkInformationIntegerKey* UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER();
{% endhighlight %}

* vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline.cxx:

{% highlight cpp %}
vtkInformationKeyMacro(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline, UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER, Integer);
{% endhighlight %}

`vtkInformationVector` is a simple vector of `vtkInformation` objects. Here
is a demonstration.

{% highlight python %}
key = keys.MakeKey(keys.IntegerKey, "another key", "some class")

iv = vtk.vtkInformationVector()

i1 = vtk.vtkInformation()
i1.Set(key, 10)
iv.Append(i1)

i2 = vtk.vtkInformation()
i2.Set(key, 20)
iv.Append(i2)

print iv

for i in range(2):
    print iv.GetInformationObject(i)
{% endhighlight %}

This will print the following.

{% highlight sh %}
vtkInformationVector (0x7ff513e40f10)

  Reference Count: 1
  Registered Events: (none)

      another key: 20

{% endhighlight %}

### Connecting algorithms to create pipelines

Next, let's check out how algorithms are connected together to form
pipelines. Below is a simple pipeline consisting of 2 sources (s0 and s1)
and 3 filters (f0, f1 and f2).

<img src="/assets/example-pipeline.png" alt="example pipeline" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto"/>

* During execution, data flows in the direction of the arrows,
* s0, s1 and s2 are simple sources with 1 output each,
* f0 is a filter with 2 inputs and 1 output. The first input (input 0) is repeatable,
* f1 and f2 are simple filters with 1 input and 1 output.

The code to create this pipeline would look something like this:

{% highlight python %}
s0 = Source()
s1 = Source()
s2 = Source()

f0 = Filter0()
f0.AddInputConnection(0, s0.GetOutputPort())
f0.AddInputConnection(0, s1.GetOutputPort())
f0.SetInputConnection(1, s2.GetOutputPort())

f1 = Filter1()
f1.SetInputConnection(f0.GetOutputPort(0))

f2 = Filter1()
f2.SetInputConnection(f0.GetOutputPort(1))
{% endhighlight %}

This is enough detail about the pipeline for now. We'll cover the pipeline
execution order and passes in the next blog. Let's see what each of these
algorithm classes looks like.

**Source:**

{% highlight python %}
from vtk.util.vtkAlgorithm import VTKPythonAlgorithmBase

class Source(VTKPythonAlgorithmBase):
    def __init__(self):
        VTKPythonAlgorithmBase.__init__(self,
            nInputPorts=0,
            nOutputPorts=1, outputType='vtkPolyData')

    def RequestData(self, request, inInfo, outInfo):
        info = outInfo.GetInformationObject(0)
        output = vtk.vtkPolyData.GetData(info)
        print info
        return 1
{% endhighlight %}

When the pipeline is updated with `f1.Update()` or `f2.Update()`, the
`Source` instances will print the following 3 times.

{% highlight sh %}
vtkInformation (0x7fb87263a8b0)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 610
  Reference Count: 3
  Registered Events: (none)
  PRODUCER: vtkCompositeDataPipeline(0x7fb872638730) port 0
  UPDATE_EXTENT_INITIALIZED: 0
  UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER: 0
  UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES: 1
  UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS: 0
  DATA_OBJECT: vtkPolyData(0x7fb8726428c0)
  CONSUMERS: vtkCompositeDataPipeline(0x7fb8726397d0) port 0
{% endhighlight %}

This class is pretty self-explanatory. Note how in `RequestData()`,
there is a direct relationship between the contents of `inInfo` and
the input connections and `outInfo` and output connections.  In the
cae of a source, `outInfo`, which is a `vtkInformationVector` contains
only one `vtkInformation` object corresponding to the only output.
`InInfo` on the other hand will be empty since this is a source and
has no input ports.

**Filter1:**

{% highlight python %}
class Filter1(VTKPythonAlgorithmBase):
    def __init__(self):
        VTKPythonAlgorithmBase.__init__(self,
            nInputPorts=1, inputType='vtkPolyData',
            nOutputPorts=1, outputType='vtkPolyData')

    def RequestData(self, request, inInfo, outInfo):
        info = inInfo[0].GetInformationObject(0)
        input = vtk.vtkPolyData.GetData(info)
        info = outInfo.GetInformationObject(0)
        output = vtk.vtkPolyData.GetData(info)
        return 1
{% endhighlight %}

This is also fairly straightforward. A filter with one input and one output.
`InInfo` will contain one `vtkInformationVector` (first input port) which will
contain one `vtkInformation` (first and the only connection).

Finally, let's look at `Filter0`, which is the most complicated algorithm
in the example:

{% highlight python %}
class Filter0(VTKPythonAlgorithmBase):
    def __init__(self):
        VTKPythonAlgorithmBase.__init__(self,
            nInputPorts=2, inputType='vtkPolyData',
            nOutputPorts=2, outputType='vtkPolyData')

    def FillInputPortInformation(self, port, info):
        if port == 0:
            info.Set(vtk.vtkAlgorithm.INPUT_IS_REPEATABLE(), 1)
        return 1

    def RequestData(self, request, inInfo, outInfo):
        print inInfo
        print inInfo[0], inInfo[1]
        info = inInfo[0].GetInformationObject(0)
        input = vtk.vtkPolyData.GetData(info)
        info = outInfo.GetInformationObject(0)
        output = vtk.vtkPolyData.GetData(info)
        return 1
{% endhighlight %}

Overall, this algorithm still looks fairly simple. Its one unusual attribute
is how it sets the first port to be repeatable in `FillInputPortInformation`.
This means that this port can accept an arbitrary number of connections, which
are established using `AddInputConnection()`. The most common example of such
an algorithm is `vtkAppendFilter`. This filter accepts multiple inputs, which
it appends together to produce 1 output.

When the pipeline is updated, this will print the following.

{% highlight sh %}
((vtkInformationVector)0x11665b830, (vtkInformationVector)0x11665b8f0)
vtkInformationVector (0x7fc52058be30)

      UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_PIECES: 1
      UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS: 0
      DATA_OBJECT: vtkPolyData(0x7fc5205946b0)

 vtkInformationVector (0x7fc52058be90)
  Debug: Off
  Modified Time: 124
  Reference Count: 2
  Registered Events: (none)
  Number of Information Objects: 1
  Information Objects:
    vtkInformation(0x7fc52058e610):

      UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS: 0
      DATA_OBJECT: vtkPolyData(0x7fc520594e50)
{% endhighlight %}

If you look at the output carefully, you will notice that `inInfo` contains
2 `vtkInformationVector` objects, each corresponding to 2 input ports.
The first port is repeatable and contains 2 connections. Therefore, the
first `vtkInformationVector` contains 2 `vtkInformation` objects. The
second port accepts only 1 connection and hence the second `vtkInformationVector`
contains only `vtkInformation` object.

Hopefully, this gives you enough information to get started with writing
basic algorithms. In my next blog, I will cover how the pipelines performs
multiple passes during execution and how these passes are implement by
algorithms.
