title:  "A VTK pipeline primer (part 3)"
---

In previous blogs ([1]({% post_url 2014-9-18-pipeline %}),
[2]({% post_url 2014-10-05-pipeline-2 %})), I started discussing how the VTK
pipeline functions. We covered the basics and how `RequestInformation` works.
In this article, we will discover how `RequestUpdateExtent` and `RequestData`
work. Once you have a good understanding of these 3 passes, you can develop
all kinds of algorithms, ranging from very basic to sophisticated.

## RequestUpdateExtent

This pass is where algorithms can make requests for the upstream pipeline
to fulfill. Its name originates from the first use case for this pass:
requesting a subset of logical extent from an image source (aka update
extent). In the current VTK, this pass is used for requesting many other
things including time steps, partitions (pieces), ghost levels etc. Let's
dig into an example. First let's create a request key with the following.

{% highlight python %}
requestKey = keys.MakeKey(keys.IntegerRequestKey, "a request", "my module")
{% endhighlight %}

Then let's make a request using this key (at the end of the file):

{% highlight python %}
f.UpdateInformation()
outInfo = f.GetOutputInformation(0)
outInfo.Set(requestKey, 0)
f.PropagateUpdateExtent()
{% endhighlight %}

Let's also change the filter and the source to print out the keys in the
information objects during `RequestUpdateExtent`:

{% highlight python %}
class MySource(VTKPythonAlgorithmBase):
    def RequestUpdateExtent(self, request, inInfo, outInfo):
        print "MySource RequestUpdateExtent:"
        print outInfo.GetInformationObject(0)
        return 1

class MyFilter(VTKPythonAlgorithmBase):
    def RequestUpdateExtent(self, request, inInfo, outInfo):
        print "MyFilter RequestUpdateExtent:"
        print outInfo.GetInformationObject(0)
        return 1
{% endhighlight %}

Now when we run our example, here is the output:

{% highlight sh %}
MyFilter RequestUpdateExtent:
vtkInformation (0x7fae09e73650)
  ...
  a request: 0

MySource RequestUpdateExtent:
vtkInformation (0x7fae09e732d0)
  ...
  a request: 0
{% endhighlight %}

So far, we let the pipeline simply copy upstream the `a request` key. However,
it is sometimes necessary for a filter to modify a request value during the
`RequestUpdateExtent` pass. For example, a filter may need a layer of ghost
cells to produce piece-independent results and may add a ghost level to the
request. Let's change `MyFilter`'s `RequestUpdateExtent` to increment the value
of `a request`.

{% highlight python %}
class MyFilter(VTKPythonAlgorithmBase):
    def RequestUpdateExtent(self, request, inInfo, outInfo):
        print "MyFilter RequestUpdateExtent:"
        print outInfo.GetInformationObject(0)
        areq = outInfo.GetInformationObject(0).Get(requestKey)
        inInfo[0].GetInformationObject(0).Set(requestKey, areq + 1)
        return 1
{% endhighlight %}

Now the output will look as follows:

{% highlight sh %}
MyFilter RequestUpdateExtent:
vtkInformation (0x7fae09e73650)
  ...
  a request: 0

MySource RequestUpdateExtent:
vtkInformation (0x7fae09e732d0)
  ...
  a request: 1
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a graphical representation of what is going on.

![meta-data2](/assets/meta-data2.png)

Simple huh? A few things to note:

* Certain keys are copied upstream by the pipeline automatically during
`RequestUpdateExtent`. These include all keys of type `vtkInformationIntegerRequestKey`,
`UPDATE_EXTENT`, `UPDATE_NUMBER_OF_GHOST_LEVELS`, `UPDATE_PIECE_NUMBER` etc.

* Any automatic copying happens before the algorithm's `RequestUpdateExtent`
is called so that it can overwrite anything done by the pipeline.

We are now done covering all of the meta-data passes. In summary:

* In `RequestInformation`, the source produces meta-data, the pipeline copies these
values downstream by default and the filters modify the meta-data as it
propagates downstream.

* In `RequestUpdateExtent`, the sink (or the user at the
end of the pipeline) makes requests and as these values propagate upstream,
filters modify them to fit their needs.

## RequestData

Hopefully, this section is trivial to most readers. In `RequestData`, data,
originally produced by sources, is transformed by filters as it propagates
downstream. This is very similar to `RequestInformation`, the main difference
is that "heavy" data is processed in `RequestData` as opposed to meta (light)
data in `RequestInformation`.

In this pass, algorithms deal with the `vtkDataObject.DATA_OBJECT()` key, which
is preset by the pipeline or the algorithm (more on this some other time). Let's
modify our example to do some work in `RequestData`:

{% highlight python %}
1  class MySource(VTKPythonAlgorithmBase):
2      def RequestData(self, request, inInfo, outInfo):
3          print "MySource RequestData:"
4          outInfo0 = outInfo.GetInformationObject(0)
5          areq = outInfo0.Get(requestKey)
6          s = vtk.vtkSphereSource()
7          s.SetRadius(areq)
8          s.Update()
9          output = outInfo0.Get(vtk.vtkDataObject.DATA_OBJECT())
10         output.ShallowCopy(s.GetOutput())
11         print output
12         return 1
13 
14 class MyFilter(VTKPythonAlgorithmBase):
15     def RequestData(self, request, inInfo, outInfo):
16         print "MyFilter RequestData:"
17         inInfo0 = inInfo[0].GetInformationObject(0)
18         outInfo0 = outInfo.GetInformationObject(0)
19         input = inInfo0.Get(vtk.vtkDataObject.DATA_OBJECT())
20         output = outInfo0.Get(vtk.vtkDataObject.DATA_OBJECT())
21         sh = vtk.vtkShrinkPolyData()
22         sh.SetInputData(input)
23         sh.Update()
24         output.ShallowCopy(sh.GetOutput())
25         print output
26         return 1
{% endhighlight %}

The source and the filter extract their output from the output information
on lines 9 and 20 respectively. Note that these objects are guaranteed to
exist and be of type `vtkPolyData` by the pipeline code. The type is determined
by the constructor code, which looks like this:

{% highlight python %}
class MyFilter(VTKPythonAlgorithmBase):
    def __init__(self):
        VTKPythonAlgorithmBase.__init__(self,
            nInputPorts=1, inputType='vtkPolyData',
            nOutputPorts=1, outputType='vtkPolyData')
{% endhighlight %}

The source uses the request object (line 5) to set the radius of the sphere that
it produces (line 7). This is a good example of how source and filters can use
the request objects in their `RequestData` methods (for example to read a particular
time step or a spatial subset).

This is it! Hopefully, now you have a good understanding of the inner working of
the VTK pipeline. We'll get to put this knowledge to use in upcoming blogs. You
can find the full example [on this page](https://github.com/berkgeveci/berkgeveci.github.io/blob/jekyll/code/2014-09-16-pipeline/pipeline.py). I also recommend taking a
look at [this blog]({% post_url 2014-9-13-h5py-reader %}) as it demonstrates how these concepts are used in developing
an HDF5 reader.
